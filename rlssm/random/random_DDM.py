    Parameters
    ----------

    drift : numpy.ndarray
        Shape is usually (n_samples, n_trials).
        Drift-rate of the diffusion decision model.

    threshold : numpy.ndarray
        Shape is usually (n_samples, n_trials).
        Threshold of the diffusion decision model.

    ndt : numpy.ndarray
        Shape is usually (n_samples, n_trials).

    Optional Parameters
    -------------------

    rel_sp : numpy.ndarray or float, default .5
        When is an array , shape is usually (n_samples, n_trials).
        Relative starting point of the diffusion decision model.

    noise_constant : float, default 1
        Scaling factor of the diffusion decision model.
        If changed, drift and threshold would be scaled accordingly.
        Not to be changed in most applications.

    dt : float, default 0.001
        Controls the time resolution of the diffusion decision model. Default is 1 msec.
        Lower values of dt make the function more precise but much slower.

        Controls the maximum rts that can be predicted.
        Making this higher might make the function a bit slower.

    Note
    ----
    When `gen_drift_trial_sd` is not specified, there is no across-trial variability
    in the drift-rate.

    Instead, when `gen_drift_trial_sd` is specified, the trial-by-trial drift-rate

    - drift ~ normal(gen_drift, gen_drift_trial_sd).

    Similarly, when `gen_rel_sp_trial_sd` is not specified, there is no across-trial
    variability starting point.

    Instead, when `gen_rel_sp_trial_sd` is specified, the trial-by-trial relative
    starting point has the following distribution:

    - rel_sp ~ Phi(normal(rel_sp, gen_rel_sp_trial_sd)).

    In this case, `gen_rel_sp` is first trasformed to the -Inf/+Inf scale,
    so the input value is the same (no bias still corresponds to .5).

    Parameters
    ----------

    n_trials : int
        Number of trials to be simulated.

    gen_drift : float
        Drift-rate of the diffusion decision model.

    gen_threshold : float
        Threshold of the diffusion decision model.
        Should be positive.

    gen_ndt : float
        Non decision time of the diffusion decision model, in seconds.
        Should be positive.

    Optional Parameters
    -------------------

    gen_rel_sp : float, default .5
        Relative starting point of the diffusion decision model.
        Should be higher than 0 and smaller than 1.
        When is 0.5 (default), there is no bias.

    participant_label : string or float, default 1
        What will appear in the participant column of the output data.

    gen_drift_trial_sd : float, default None
        Across trial variability in the drift-rate.
        Should be positive.

    gen_rel_sp_trial_sd : float, default None
        Across trial variability in the realtive starting point.
        Should be positive.
