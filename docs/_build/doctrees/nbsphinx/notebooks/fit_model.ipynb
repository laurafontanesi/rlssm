    "To fit a model, there are 3 main things to specify:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Data:**\n",
    "The `data`, which should be in the form of a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different model classes might require different columns in the data. You should check in the [API Reference](https://rlssm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models/model_classes.html) of each model class (or using `model.fit?`) what the required data columns are.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The priors (optional):**\n",
    "You can decide whether to use the default priors (which you can see after initializing the model) or whether you want to change the mean or SD of the prior or hyper-prior distributions. Whether you changed the priors or not, they are always printed out when the model starts fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Sampling parameters:**\n",
    "The sampling parameters **(number of chains, iterations, warmups, thinning, etc.)** are the arguments to the `pystan.StanModel.sampling()` function, and we simply refer to the [pystan documentation](https://pystan.readthedocs.io/) for a better overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional learning parameters:**\n",
    "While all sequential sampling models (DDM and race models) **without a learning component** only require a `data` argument, all models with a learning components (RL models, RLDDMs, and RL+race models) also require a `K` argument, which is the total number of different options in a learning block (note that this can be different from the number of options presented in each trial), and `initial_value_learning`, which is the initial Q value (before learning)."
