This package was developed by me, **Laura Fontanesi**, with the help of **Amir Hosein Hadian Rasanan** and **Andrei Birgovan**.

When using this package or part of the code for your own research, I ask you to **cite us (using the Zenodo DOI below)** and to always perform a parameter recovery, to make sure that everything is working as it should. Even though we tested all functions, I cannot assure that it will work perfectly on all platforms and data formats. Therefore, feedback on usage and issues is especially welcomed at this stage :)
